# DatoCMS Next.js starter

Everything you need to know to build a Next.js project powered by DatoCMS.

## Featuring

- [Fetching content](lib/fetch-content.ts) from DatoCMS
- Using [DatoCMS Cache Tags](lib/cache-tags.ts)
- Using [DatoCMS React components](https://github.com/datocms/react-datocms)

## Getting Started

Begin with setting a `PUBLIC_DATOCMS_API_TOKEN` in `.env.local`.
You can use `.env.local.example` as a starting point and retrieve the token from
your DatoCMS project.

Then create an account on Turso (unless you already have one) and
authenticate like explained in the [quickstart
documentation](https://docs.turso.tech/quickstart). Stop following the 
tutorial before creating any database: that will be one of the next steps.

Then run `npm install` (or the equivalent command for your package manager of choice).
Now the DatoCMS GraphQL schema has been downloaded.

Now you must create a Turso database: run `npm run setup-database` and, in a few
seconds, you will see the new database appearing on the [Turso
dashboard](https://turso.tech/app/databases).

Retrieve the database URL and create a database token with the following commands:

```bash
turso db show nextjs-with-cache-tags
turso db tokens create nextjs-with-cache-tags
```

Finally copy paste the URL and the token in your `.env.local` file for
`TURSO_DATABASE_URL` and `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN` env variables.

Now you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Learn More
