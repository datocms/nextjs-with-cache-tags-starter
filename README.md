## Getting Started

### Step 1: Clone the DatoCMS project

Start by pressing this button to create a new project on DatoCMS containing the data expected by this project:

[![Clone DatoCMS project](https://dashboard.datocms.com/clone/button.svg)](https://dashboard.datocms.com/clone?projectId=23796&name=Next.js+%2B+Cache+Tags)

### Step 2: Environment variables

Use `.env.local.example` file as a starting point:

```bash
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Now open `.env.local` and start populating the variables:

##### `WEBHOOK_TOKEN`

Any secure random string. It will be used to authenticate the webhook requests that come from DatoCMS.

##### `PUBLIC_DATOCMS_API_TOKEN`

An API token from the DatoCMS project you just created. [Learn to create an API token](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-delivery-api/authentication).

##### `TURSO_DATABASE_URL`, `TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN`

Follow the first two steps of the [Turso Quickstart
](https://docs.turso.tech/quickstart) ("Install the Turso CLI" and "Signup to Turso"), then create a new database by running `npm run setup-database`. In a few seconds, the new database should appear on the [Turso dashboard](https://turso.tech/app/databases).

You can then retrieve the database URL and create a database token with the following commands:

```bash
# Fill in TURSO_DATABASE_URL with:
turso db show nextjs-with-cache-tags --url

# Fill in TURSO_AUTH_TOKEN with:
turso db tokens create nextjs-with-cache-tags
```

### Step 3: Install dependencies and download the DatoCMS GraphQL Schema

Simply run `npm install` (or the equivalent command for your package manager of choice): a `schema.graphql` will be generated.

### Step 4: Run development server

Now you can run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Deployment

The project works well on both Vercel and Netlify. Just make sure to set the environment variables as previously described.

**Important:** Once the site is deployed and you know the final domain, you need to set up a ["Invalidate cache tag" webhook](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-delivery-api/cache-tags#step-3-implement-the-invalidate-cache-tag-webhook) on your DatoCMS project, configured like this:

<img src="https://github.com/datocms/nextjs-with-cache-tags-starter/raw/main/images/webhook.png" width="500" />

## Useful resources to navigate the code

This repository aims to demonstrate how you can selectively invalidate the Next.js cache when receiving DatoCMS Cache Tags invalidation events. Before exploring this repository, it's very useful to understand the general concepts behind Cache Tags:

- DatoCMS Cache Tags: [Announcement](https://www.datocms.com/blog/introducing-datocms-cache-tags), [Documentation](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-delivery-api/cache-tags)
- Cache Tags with Next.js: [Guide](https://www.datocms.com/docs/next-js/using-cache-tags)

The code essentially consists of two parts that are strongly interdependent:

### Execution of GraphQL queries

The [`executeQuery()` function](https://github.com/datocms/nextjs-with-cache-tags-starter/blob/main/lib/fetch-content.ts#L20) is responsible for executing a GraphQL query using the DatoCMS Content Delivery API and caching the result. To support cache invalidation, the request is tagged with a unique identifier in the Next.js Data Cache.

A mapping between the unique identifier of the query, and the DatoCMS Cache Tags returned in the response are stored in a persistent database. We use a [simple table](https://github.com/datocms/nextjs-with-cache-tags-starter/blob/main/schema.sql) made up of just two columns:

* `query_id` (TEXT): A unique identifier for the query, used to tag the request;
* `cache_tag` (TEXT): The actual cache tag returned by the query.

We selected Turso because it's an incredibly cost-effective solution and is compatible with any hosting service. However, any other storage solution would be just as effective due to the simplicity of the saved data. You can switch the storage option by adjusting the code in [`lib/database.ts`](https://github.com/datocms/nextjs-with-cache-tags-starter/blob/main/lib/database.ts).

### "Cache Tags Invalidation" webhook

The [route handler `/api/invalidate-cache-tags`](https://github.com/datocms/nextjs-with-cache-tags-starter/blob/main/app/api/invalidate-cache-tags/route.ts) receives ["Cache Tag Invalidation" events from a DatoCMS webhook](https://www.datocms.com/docs/content-delivery-api/cache-tags#step-3-implement-the-invalidate-cache-tag-webhook) and is responsible for invalidating every cached GraphQL query that is linked to those tags.

Since the `executeQuery()`:

- Tags each GraphQL request with a unique ID in the Next.js Data Cache, and
- Saves the "Query ID <-> Cache Tags" mapping on a Turso database.

The endpoint can query the database to find the query IDs associated with the received tags, and use `revalidateTag()` to invalidate the relevant requests.
